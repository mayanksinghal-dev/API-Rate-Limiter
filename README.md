# üö¶ Spring Boot Rate Limiter Library

A **high-performance, extensible, and plug-and-play** Rate Limiting library built with **Spring Boot**, **Redis**, and **Lua scripting**. Designed to be dropped into **enterprise-scale** applications with **multi-tiered** user support (Free, Premium, etc.) and minimal effort.

---

## üß† Why This Project?

API Rate Limiting is crucial for:
- Preventing abuse and DoS attacks
- Managing traffic from different users
- Enabling monetization (freemium/premium tiers)
- Guaranteeing fair usage across consumers

| üí° Lua + Redis for Accuracy   | Uses Lua scripts for atomicity and concurrency safety in Redis              |
| üßµ Thread-safe Design          | Designed with concurrency and thread safety in mind                         |
| üöÄ Tested at Scale             | 1000+ concurrent users with 1.0 APDEX (JMeter tested)                       |
| üì¶ Ready for Packaging         | Can be published as a plug-and-play Java library for use in any project     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Redis**
- **Lua scripting**
- **JWT (for user tiers)**
- **Apache JMeter** (for performance testing)

---

## üìà Performance & Testing

Tested using **Apache JMeter** with **1000 concurrent virtual users**, achieving:
- **APDEX Score**: `1.0` (Excellent)
- **First response latency**: ~1.5s (warm-up)
- **Average response latency**: ~30-50ms (post warm-up)

### üî¨ Real Optimizations Implemented

- Replaced in-memory variables with **Redis-backed, distributed-safe** counters.
- Used **Lua scripting** for atomic operations (refill, consume).
- Abstracted algorithms to avoid lock contention and improve **multi-threaded scalability**.
- Resolved **memory leaks** and high GC pressure from naive increment/expire logic.

---

## üß† Architectural Highlights

- **Interceptor-based request handling**
- **Dynamic algorithm resolver** per user tier
- **Dynamic key strategy resolver** based on request URI/IP/User
- **RedisTemplate abstraction** for shared counters
- **Lua-based Token Bucket** for concurrency-safe request throttling
- **JWT-based policy resolution** (no DB lookup required)
